## 📁 Results Directory (Local Artifacts)

The `results/` directory contains **locally generated artifacts** produced during
training and analysis. Due to their size and reproducibility, **large artifacts
such as trained model weights and bulk Grad-CAM visualizations are intentionally
excluded from version control** via `.gitignore`.

These files can be regenerated by following the execution steps outlined below.
